# Accessibility-Standards

## Description

The focus of this project was to learn how to adhere to accessibility standards when writing HTML.  During this process the code was simplified by eliminating CSS that was repetitive, adding semantic elements, as well as alt text to provide a description of the photographs used by the website.  While making these changes to the HTML and CSS it was important that the website remained in the same condition as it was before making alterations. 


## Installation

For this project we were given the source code. Once given the source code the HTML and CCS was edited and simplified while keeping the appearance of the website the same.
